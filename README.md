# The Odin Project - Foundations Landing Page

The project of creating a landing page after completion of the HTML/CSS part in The Odin Project - Foundations course.

## Goal

To create a simple web page from scratch, based on design provided in a pdf file. One should use the techniques learned in HTML/CSS part of the course, with the main focus on flexbox.

The page does not need to look good on a mobile - this is not a scope of that project.

### Design - Desired outcome
